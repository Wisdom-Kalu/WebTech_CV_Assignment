# WebTech_CV_Assignment

This assignment is designed for me to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. I am going to model/replicate the Ashesi Career Service CV format/Style using HTML CSS and JavaScript. In this exercise I used no framework, plugin or library. I coded everything from scratch.

# Features of the CV
Index.html page will be a form with the following fields:

First Name
Middle Name
Last Name
Gender: dropdown – ‘male’ and ‘female’
Phone number
Email
Address

# Other features
The above will constitute the dynamic parts of the CV. Meaning, when a user submits the form, the details goes to the second page (cv.html) where the profile sections of the CV is updated with the form data and the rest remains static.

Other sections replicated on the CV includes; education background (fixed content), work experience (fixed content) and all the other sections of an Ashesi CV format (fixed content).

# Algorithm/Logic
I performed a JavaScript form validation to make sure that the name fields accepts only texts, phone number accepts only numbers and email is in the correct format. I mostly used decision statements and regular expressions to code this assignment.
